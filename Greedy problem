Ⅴ.Greedy Algorithm
  Local solution deduces the global solution. 
  For instance:
  Leetcode376:Wiggle subsequence
    Local solution:when the prediff(previous number minus current number) is more than and equal to zero and 
  curdiff(current number minus next number) is less than zero or prediff is less than and equal to zero and 
  curdiff is more than zero,the number of wiggle subsequence increases by 1.
  Traversing first n-1 number,we are about to get the global solution.
  curdiff = nums[i+1] - nums[i];
            if (prediff <= 0 && curdiff > 0 || prediff >= 0 && curdiff < 0)
            {
                res++;
                prediff = curdiff;
            }


Leetcode 53:Maximum subarray
Local solution:when the current accumulation is less than the current number,we drop the accumulation and restart accumulating from current number on,simultaneously recording the maximum value of accumulation.
sum += nums[i];
            if (sum < nums[i])
                sum = nums[i];
            res = max(res, sum);
